The project on spatial analysis of air pollutants was done utilizing principal component analysis (PCA) and hierarchical clustering (HC). There were two main goals for the project: optimizing air network monitoring stations in the North Central Texas and determining the relationship between air pollution clusters and asthma. Data on asthma visits, GIS, air pollution, and meteorological data were obtained from various credible sources. First, PCA was applied for feature extraction and dimensionality reduction. Together, the first two components explained 70.23% of the total variance. Then, HC was performed. 5-year averages, Euclidean distance, optimal linkage functions were thoroughly computed to determine the best possible dendrogram showing the final three clusters. From these clusters, we were able to determine the emission sources and determine implications on asthma pattern. The rural cluster exhibiting low concentration of air pollutants and low temperature with low number of asthma visits while the two urban clusters comprised air monitoring stations with the highest level of most air pollutants and temperature, corresponding to the high number of asthma visits. The results were used to recommend a more reasonable placement of stations and published at the American Thoracic Society conference.
